# About Me
* I am a researcher in the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI). I received my PhD degree from Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) in May 2016. After that I had been a visiting scholar and lecturer of [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/home), [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) and [the University of Bonn](https://www.him.uni-bonn.de/) in Germany. 

* My research interests lie in the general area of signal processing, high-dimensional data analysis, non-convex optimization and applications. 


# Recent Highlights
