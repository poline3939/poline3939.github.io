# About Me
* I am a researcher in the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI). I received my PhD degree from Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) in May 2016. After that I had been a visiting scholar and lecturer of Department of Mathematics in [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/home) and [Duke University](https://duke.edu/). I had also been a visiting scholar of Hausdorff Institute of Mathematics of [the University of Bonn](https://www.him.uni-bonn.de/) in Germany in 2016. 

* My research interests lie in the general area of signal processing, high-dimensional data analysis, non-convex optimization and applications. 


# Recent Highlights
* June 2022: I am invited to give talks on 2022 SIAM Meeting of Mathematics of Data Science.
