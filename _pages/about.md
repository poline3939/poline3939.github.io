# About Me
* I am a researcher in the [Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI)](https://www.astri.org/). I received my PhD degree from Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) in May 2016. After that I had been a visiting scholar and lecturer of Department of Mathematics in [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/home) and [Duke University](https://duke.edu/). I had also been a visiting scholar of [Hausdorff Institute of Mathematics](https://www.him.uni-bonn.de/) of [the University of Bonn](https://www.him.uni-bonn.de/) in Germany in 2016. 

* My research interests lie in the general area of signal processing, high-dimensional data analysis, non-convex optimization and applications. 


# Recent Highlights
* June 2022: I am invited to give talks on 2022 [SIAM Meeting of Mathematics of Data Science](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/mds22?_ga=2.240695686.449870411.1654046966-1548619038.1643186184).  
* June 2022: Our phase retrieval paper is accepted by the 2022 [IEEE International Conference in Image Processing (ICIP)](https://2022.ieeeicip.org/) and [Handbook of Mathematical Models and Algorithms in Computer Vision and Imaging](https://link.springer.com/referencework/10.1007/978-3-030-03009-4).
