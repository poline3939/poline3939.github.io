# About Me
* I am a staff researcher in the [Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks](https://www.hkstp.org). I received my PhD degree from Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) in May 2016. After that I had been a visiting scholar and lecturer of Department of Mathematics in [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/home) and [Duke University](https://duke.edu/). I have worked as a lead engineer in the [Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research Institute (ASTRI)](https://www.astri.org/) from 2020 to 2022. I had also been a visiting scholar of [Hausdorff Institute of Mathematics](https://www.him.uni-bonn.de/) of [the University of Bonn](https://www.him.uni-bonn.de/) in Germany in 2016. 

* My research interests lie in the general area of signal processing, high-dimensional data analysis, non-convex optimization and applications. 


# Recent Highlights
